# KWS Example

The Keyword Spotting application demonstrates Machine Learning running in a [TrustedFirmware-M](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/) controlled secure/non-secure partition configuration on Arm Corstone™-300 series platforms utilizing the [Ethos™-U55](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u55) microNPU.  The ML application executes within the non-secure side of the Armv8-M processor coordinating data flow to and from the [Ethos™-U55](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u55).

In this folder you will find all the source code needed that implements the Keyword spotting application.
