# KWS Example

## Presentation

The KWS example demonstrates machine learning running on the non-secure side on Corstone 300.

Depending on the keyword recognized, LEDs of the system are turned ON or OFF:

- LED1:
  - _Yes_: on
  - _No_: off
- LED2:
  - _Go_: on
  - _Stop_: off
- LED3:
  - _Up_: on
  - _Down_: off
- LED4:
  - _Left_: on
  - _Right_: off
- LED5:
  - _On_: on
  - _Off_: off

The sixth LED blinks at a regular interval to indicate that the system is alive and waits for input.

##Â Connection to AWS cloud

The system can be connected to the AWS cloud and broadcast the ML inference results
to the cloud in an MQTT topic or receive OTA update.

Details of the AWS configuration can be found in the main [README](../README.md)
