## Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin

Each commit must have at least one `Signed-off-by:` line from the committer to certify that the contribution is made under the terms of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](./DCO.txt).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git configuration, you can add a signoff to your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You have to use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot be made). This is because the DCO is a legally binding document.

## Code owners

Technical ownership of most parts of the codebase falls on the code owners
listed in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file. An acknowledgement from these code owners is required before they merge a contribution.
