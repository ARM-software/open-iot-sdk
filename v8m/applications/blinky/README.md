# Blinky Example

Blinky demonstrates a [TrustedFirmware-M](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/) controlled secure/non-secure partition configuration on the following Arm platforms:
* Corstone-300
* Corstone-310

The code in the non-secure side of the Armv8-M processor periodically blinks a set of LEDs.

In this folder you will find all the source code needed that implements the Blinky application.
